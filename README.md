# 📖 Automatic Novel Generation Tool

[中文文档](./README_zh-CN.md) | English

> ~~Currently I don't have much energy to maintain this project. The project brings no revenue, and with graduation approaching I have many other priorities. If time permits in the future I may consider a refactor using newer technologies. — 2025/09/24~~
>
>- ~~**(2026/03/09):** This project will be refactored soon, featuring modern implementations and fresh creative concepts.~~
>
> **Update (2026/03/25):** The refactored version has completed initial development (only the main framework is done, features are not yet available) and will be uploaded to the dev branch within a week. Subsequent development will also be synchronized on the branch.

## 🛠 Environment Preparation
Ensure the environment meets the following requirements:
- **Python 3.9+** (recommended 3.10–3.12)
- **pip** package manager
- Valid API keys:
   - Cloud services: OpenAI / DeepSeek, etc.
   - Local services: Ollama or other OpenAI-compatible interfaces

---

## 📥 Installation
1. **Download the project**  
    - Download the project ZIP from [GitHub](https://github.com) or clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/YILING0013/AI_NovelGenerator
       ```


2. **Install build tools (optional)**  
    - If some packages fail to install, visit [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to download and install C++ build tools required by some modules.
    - By default the installer includes MSBuild only; make sure to select **C++ Desktop Development** from the workload list.

3. **Install dependencies and run**  
    - Open a terminal and change to the project directory:
       ```bash
       cd AI_NovelGenerator
       ```
    - Install project dependencies:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
    - After installation run the main program:
       ```bash
       python main.py
       ```

If some dependencies are still missing, manually run:
```bash
pip install <package-name>
```
to install them.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide
### 📌 Basic configuration (`config.json`)
```json
{
   "api_key": "sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
   "interface_format": "OpenAI",
   "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
   "temperature": 0.7,
   "max_tokens": 4096,
   "embedding_api_key": "sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "embedding_interface_format": "OpenAI",
   "embedding_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
   "embedding_model_name": "text-embedding-ada-002",
   "embedding_retrieval_k": 4,
   "topic": "The protagonist of Star Rail travels to Genshin Impact's Teyvat continent, saves it, and develops complex relationships with its characters.",
   "genre": "Fantasy",
   "num_chapters": 120,
   "word_number": 4000,
   "filepath": "D:/AI_NovelGenerator/filepath"
}
```

### 🔧 Explanation
1. **Generation model configuration**
   - `api_key`: API key for the LLM service
   - `base_url`: API endpoint (for local services use the Ollama address)
   - `interface_format`: Interface mode
   - `model_name`: Main generation model (e.g., gpt-4, claude-3)
   - `temperature`: Creativity parameter (0–1, higher is more creative)
   - `max_tokens`: Maximum model response length

2. **Embedding model configuration**
   - `embedding_model_name`: Embedding model name (e.g., Ollama's nomic-embed-text)
   - `embedding_url`: Service endpoint
   - `embedding_retrieval_k`: Number of nearest neighbors to retrieve

3. **Novel parameters**
   - `topic`: Core story theme
   - `genre`: Genre
   - `num_chapters`: Total number of chapters
   - `word_number`: Target words per chapter
   - `filepath`: Path to save generated files

## 🚀 Run Instructions
### Method 1 — Run with Python
```bash
python main.py
```
This launches the GUI for interactive use.

### Method 2 — Build an executable
If you want to run the tool on machines without Python, package it with **PyInstaller**:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller main.spec
```
After packaging an executable (e.g., `main.exe` on Windows) will appear in the `dist/` folder.

## 📘 User Guide
1. **After launching the app, fill in the basic parameters:**  
   - **API Key & Base URL** (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`)  
   - **Model name** (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o`)  
   - **Temperature** (0–1, controls creative variance)  
   - **Topic** (e.g., "AI uprising in a post-apocalyptic world")  
   - **Genre** (e.g., "Sci-fi" / "Fantasy" / "Urban Fantasy")  
   - **Number of chapters** and **words per chapter** (e.g., 10 chapters × ~3000 words)  
   - **Save path** (create a new output folder for results)

2. **Click "Step1. Generate Settings"**  
   - The system will generate, based on topic/genre/chapter count:  
     - `Novel_setting.txt`: Worldbuilding, characters, trigger points and foreshadowing.  
   - You can view or edit these settings after generation.

3. **Click "Step2. Generate Directory"**  
   - The system will use `Novel_setting.txt` to produce:  
     - `Novel_directory.txt`: Chapter titles and short prompts.  
   - You can review and modify chapter titles and descriptions.

4. **Click "Step3. Generate Chapter Draft"**  
   - Before generating a chapter you can:  
     - Set the chapter number (e.g., `1`)  
     - Provide chapter-specific guidance in the "This chapter guidance" box  
   - When you generate a chapter the system will:  
     - Read prior settings, `Novel_directory.txt`, and finalized chapters  
     - Use vector retrieval to recall relevant context for coherence  
     - Produce an outline (`outline_X.txt`) and chapter text (`chapter_X.txt`)  
   - You can view and edit the draft in the editor pane.

5. **Click "Step4. Finalize Current Chapter"**  
   - The system will:  
     - Update the global summary (`global_summary.txt`)  
     - Update character states (`character_state.txt`)  
     - Update the vector store (so future chapters can use the latest info)  
     - Update major plot points (e.g., `plot_arcs.txt`)  
   - After finalizing you will see the finalized text in `chapter_X.txt`.

6. **Consistency check (optional)**  
   - Click the "[Optional] Consistency Proofread" button to scan the latest chapter for conflicts (character logic, plot contradictions, etc.).  
   - If conflicts are detected, detailed messages will appear in the log area.

7. **Repeat steps 4–6** until all chapters are generated and finalized.

> Vector retrieval tips:
> 1. Explicitly set the embedding interface and model name.
> 2. For local Ollama embeddings start the Ollama service first:
>    ```bash
>    ollama serve  # Start the service
>    ollama pull nomic-embed-text  # Download/enable the model
>    ```
> 3. Clear the `vectorstore` directory after switching embedding models.
> 4. For cloud embeddings ensure the API permissions are enabled.

## ❓ FAQ
### Q1: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

This error usually indicates the API did not return valid JSON—sometimes an HTML error page or other unexpected content was returned.

### Q2: HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout?

Check the stability of the API endpoint and network connectivity.

### Q3: How do I switch Embedding providers?

Enter the new provider settings in the GUI fields for embedding configuration.
